----- Expressions ----
----------------------
----------------------

-- Expressions are drawn from four categories determined by the presence
-- or absence of each of the following pairs of universal properties:
--
--  - Equalizers & coequalizers
--    (Categories with them are called "refined"; those without are "unrefined")
--  - Initial algebras & terminal coalgebras
--    (Categories with them are "first-order"; those without are "zeroth-order")
--
-- The zeroth-order categories may also be called "substitution" categories.
--
-- All four categories have each of the following pairs of universal properties:
--
--  - Initial objects & terminal objects
--  - Products & coproducts
--
-- All the types until the end of the `Expression` section are zeroth-order,
-- even though they _have_ initial algebras and terminal coalgebras, because
-- they are all defined in the style of "datatypes Ã  la carte" -- in effect,
-- this means that we are programming in the category of polynomial functors
-- of the zeroth-order categories.  At the end of the `Expression` section,
-- we generate the full forms of expressions by taking the fixpoints and
-- cofixpoints of the datatypes previously defined; those types live only in
-- the first-order categories.

--------------------
---- Core types ----
--------------------

-- These types are members of at least the refined first-order category
-- (in some cases they are members of other categories as well).  They
-- may be used to help _define_ even categories which they are not themselves
-- objects of, because the _definitions_ all occur in the refined first-order
-- category.  (In particular, they all have initial algebras and terminal
-- coalgebras, which are present in the first-order categories but not the
-- zeroth-order categories.)

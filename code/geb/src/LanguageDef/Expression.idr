----- Expressions ----
----------------------
----------------------

-- Expressions are drawn from four categories determined by the presence
-- or absence of each of the following pairs of universal properties:
--
--  - Equalizers & coequalizers
--    (Categories with them are called "refined"; those without are "unrefined")
--  - Initial algebras & terminal coalgebras
--    (Categories with them are "first-order"; those without are "zeroth-order")
--
-- The zeroth-order categories may also be called "substitution" categories.
--
-- All four categories have each of the following pairs of universal properties:
--
--  - Initial objects & terminal objects
--  - Products & coproducts
--
-- All the types until the end of the `Expression` section are zeroth-order,
-- even though they _have_ initial algebras and terminal coalgebras, because
-- they are all defined in the style of "datatypes Ã  la carte" -- in effect,
-- this means that we are programming in the category of polynomial functors
-- of the zeroth-order categories.  At the end of the `Expression` section,
-- we generate the full forms of expressions by taking the fixpoints and
-- cofixpoints of the datatypes previously defined; those types live only in
-- the first-order categories.

--------------------
---- Core types ----
--------------------

-- These types are members of at least the refined first-order category
-- (in some cases they are members of other categories as well).  They
-- may be used to help _define_ even categories which they are not themselves
-- objects of, because the _definitions_ all occur in the refined first-order
-- category.  (In particular, they all have initial algebras and terminal
-- coalgebras, which are present in the first-order categories but not the
-- zeroth-order categories.)

-- Next, we introduce a way of interpreting polynomials as datatypes.
-- A polynomial endofunctor may be viewed as simply a polynomial, and
-- may be factored into one, but when representing types with
-- endofunctors, we may wish to factor out commonality amongst types
-- and compose them from smaller components. Such types could theoretically
-- be fully distributed into flat polynomials like `PolynomialF`, but
-- when using polynomials as types, we can gain expressivity with explicit
-- composition.

-- Next, we perform another recursion.  A programming language might define
-- an ADT as an initial algebra of a polynomial endofunctor.  So, we will
-- treat PolynomialF as representative of polynomial endofunctors, and
-- therefore potentially of ADTs.  To turn a polynomial endofunctor
-- which represents a non-recursive datatype into one which represents a
-- recursive type, we apply the above-defined higher-order functor,
-- `FreeMonad` (AKA `F*`).  So to generate polynomial _recursive_ types, we add
-- to `PolynomialF` the option of applying `FreeMonad` to an existing polynomial
-- type.
